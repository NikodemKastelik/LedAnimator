# LedAnimator

This project was brought to life due to Valentine's day. It is composed of home-made PCB containing ATmega8 chip, all inserted in nice 3D-printed case. Software is responsible for controlling 8x8 LED matrix in such a way, that it resembles moving string.

Result of my work can be seen here in Presentation folder and under links below:
